# Rules to normalize test outputs. Our custom diff tool passes test output
# of tests through the substitution rules in this file before doing the
# actual comparison.
#
# An example of when this is useful is when an error happens on a different
# port number, or a different worker shard, or a different placement, etc.
# because we are running the tests in a different configuration.

# Normalize the temporary database role used by local and pipeline test clusters.
