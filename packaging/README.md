# Building DocumentDB Packages With Docker

The OSS packaging contract mirrors the design in
`packaging/gateway/packaging-design.md`:

| Package | Role |
|---|---|
| `postgresql-N-documentdb` | The PostgreSQL extension for major N. File-only. |
| `documentdb-postgresql-tools` | Administrator helpers (`documentdb-tune`, `documentdb-createcluster`, `documentdb-register-gateway`, `documentdb-gateway-admin`). |
| `documentdb-gateway` | Wire-protocol translation runtime (binary + systemd unit). |
| `documentdb-common` | PG-agnostic shared payload owned once: `documentdb-setup`, `documentdb-local-reset`, the systemd template units (`documentdb-local@.target`, `documentdb-postgresql@.service`, `documentdb-gateway-local@.service`), the sysusers.d/tmpfiles.d drop-ins, helper scripts, and sample data. |
| `documentdb-N` (+ `documentdb` meta) | Per-major stand-alone package — pins PostgreSQL major N + its extension, depends on `documentdb-common` (and the gateway/tools it pulls in), and owns the per-major systemd instance lifecycle. |

**Ubuntu 24.04 LTS + PostgreSQL 18** is the paved-road default — the
`documentdb` meta package pins PostgreSQL 18, and the install/start E2E uses it
as the reference target. First-party CI builds and tests a small **Tier 1**
matrix around that default (see [What CI builds](#what-ci-builds-package-production-tiers)
below, which is the authoritative statement of the CI scope); other OS/PG
combinations are exposed by the build scripts below for community packagers and
validation runs.

## What CI builds (package-production tiers)

First-party CI does **not** build the full distro × PG-major cartesian product.
Following the norm for PostgreSQL extensions (Citus, TimescaleDB, and pgvector
are published through the shared PGDG build infrastructure rather than each
project running the whole matrix, and typically support only the newest ~3
majors), the build is tiered:

- **Tier 1 — first-party build + test + host (the guarantee).** The
  `build_all_packages.yml` full matrix builds the newest, most-used majors on
  the paved-road distros only: **PostgreSQL {17, 18}** on **Ubuntu 24.04** (DEB)
  and **RHEL/Rocky 9** (RPM), for **amd64 + arm64**. The install/start E2E
  (install → `documentdb-setup` → wire protocol) runs on **every cell of that
  matrix**, not just the paved-road default — a combination we ship is a
  combination we installed and started at least once.
- **Tier 2 / 3 — build on demand (not built by CI).** Every other supported
  combination — **PostgreSQL 15/16**, **Debian 11/12/13**, **Ubuntu 22.04**,
  **RHEL/Rocky 8** — is produced by running the version-parametric build scripts
  yourself. The packaging stays fully parametric, so a specific version is one
  command:

  ```sh
  ./packaging/build_packages.sh --os deb12 --pg 16          # extension
  ./packaging/gateway/build_gateway_packages.sh --os deb12 --pg 16 --version <V>
  ```

  PostgreSQL 15 is **extension-only**: only the `postgresql-15-documentdb`
  extension package is produced for PG 15. The PG-agnostic `documentdb-gateway`
  package still builds and installs, but package-managed setup
  (`documentdb-register-gateway` / `documentdb-setup`) rejects PG 15 because it
  requires PG 16+ — consistent with the Gateway Packages section below.

The full lists below enumerate everything the scripts *accept*; Tier 1 is the
subset CI produces automatically.

## Package version formats

One release deliberately carries two version grammars:

- **Extension packages** (`postgresql-N-documentdb`) use the control-file
  upstream form **`X.Y-Z`** (e.g. `0.117-0`; on DEB that is upstream `X.Y`
  with Debian revision `Z`, on RPM it is split into `Version: X.Y` /
  `Release: Z`... rendered as `X.Y.Z-1` in the RPM filename).
- **All other packages** (`documentdb-gateway`, `documentdb-postgresql-tools`,
  `documentdb-common`, `documentdb-N`, `documentdb` meta) use the flat dotted
  form **`X.Y.Z`** (e.g. `0.117.0`).

dpkg's comparator treats these as *different, ordered* versions
(`dpkg --compare-versions 0.117-0 ge 0.117.0` is FALSE, because upstream
`0.117` sorts before `0.117.0`), so any cross-package dependency floor that
references an **extension** package must use the dashed form. That conversion
is single-sourced as `deb_extension_dep_version` in `packaging/deb-common.sh`
— use it instead of hand-converting. Workflows convert the control-file
version to the dotted form (`X.Y-Z` → `X.Y.Z`) once, at extraction time, and
pass it to every builder via `--version` (either form is accepted and
normalized where needed).

## User-facing install paths

The design (`packaging/gateway/packaging-design.md` §5) defines three
install paths, all served by the four packages above:

- **Workflow C — Full stand-alone install (recommended default):**
  `apt install documentdb && sudo documentdb-setup --admin-user admin`.
  The meta package pulls everything in; `documentdb-setup` runs the
  greenfield or brownfield setup wizard with backup-and-rollback
  safety around every PostgreSQL-side change, and enables
  `documentdb-local.target` itself on success (pass `--no-enable` to
  defer that). There is no separate `systemctl enable --now` step.

- **Workflow A — Extension only into a managed PostgreSQL instance
  (advanced):** `apt install postgresql-18-documentdb documentdb-postgresql-tools`
  then `sudo documentdb-tune --pg-version 18 --cluster main --yes`.
  No gateway runtime, no wire-protocol endpoint — useful for ops /
  migration tooling that talks SQL directly.

- **Workflow B — Extension + gateway with BYO local PostgreSQL
  (advanced):** Workflow A plus `apt install documentdb-gateway` and
  `sudo documentdb-register-gateway --target-postgres-instance 18/main
  --admin-user admin --admin-password-file <file> --yes`. Suitable when
  the operator wants to own the PostgreSQL lifecycle themselves but
  still expose the wire protocol via a packaged gateway service.

See the design doc for the full prerequisite and rollback semantics of
each workflow.

> **RHEL / Rocky / AlmaLinux prerequisite (before any `dnf install`).**
> The DocumentDB RPMs depend on PGDG-provided PostgreSQL extension packages
> (`pgvector_N`, `pg_cron_N`, `postgis36_N`), which live in the PGDG, EPEL, and
> CodeReady Builder (CRB) repositories. On a stock RHEL-family host `dnf install
> documentdb` fails dependency resolution until those repos are enabled. Enable
> them once (adjust the EL major/arch for your host; use `powertools` instead of
> `crb` on EL8):
>
> ```bash
> sudo dnf install -y dnf-plugins-core
> sudo dnf install -y https://download.postgresql.org/pub/repos/yum/reporpms/EL-9-x86_64/pgdg-redhat-repo-latest.noarch.rpm
> sudo dnf install -y epel-release
> sudo dnf config-manager --set-enabled crb
> sudo dnf -qy module disable postgresql
> ```
>
> On EL8 replace `EL-9` with `EL-8` in the PGDG URL and use `--set-enabled
> powertools` instead of `crb`; on arm64 replace `x86_64` with `aarch64`.
> Then the RHEL install commands mirror the Debian workflows above with `dnf`
> (for example `sudo dnf install documentdb` for Workflow C). This guidance is
> also embedded in the `%description` of the extension and meta RPMs, so it is
> visible via `dnf info` before install.

> **Multi-major side-by-side on Debian/Ubuntu (advanced capability).**
> The major-agnostic files (`documentdb-setup`, the `@`-templated units, helper
> scripts, sample data, …) are owned once by the `documentdb-common` package,
> which every `documentdb-N` depends on. Because the per-major packages ship
> none of these files themselves, multiple majors co-install cleanly and
> removing one major never removes shared files a surviving major needs — the
> shared payload is removed only when the last `documentdb-N` is gone and
> `documentdb-common` is autoremoved. Each stand-alone still owns exactly one
> underlying PostgreSQL instance and one gateway, so side-by-side installs
> require the administrator to assign distinct public gateway ports for the
> non-default instances (manual configuration, not automatic allocation).

## Building Debian/Ubuntu Packages

Run `./packaging/build_packages.sh -h` and follow the instructions.
E.g. to build for Debian 12 and PostgreSQL 16, run:

```sh
./packaging/build_packages.sh --os deb12 --pg 16
```

Supported DEB/Ubuntu distributions:
- deb11 — Debian 11 (bullseye)
- deb12 — Debian 12 (bookworm)
- deb13 — Debian 13 (trixie)
- ubuntu22.04 — Ubuntu 22.04 (jammy)
- ubuntu24.04 — Ubuntu 24.04 (noble)

Supported PG versions: 15, 16, 17, 18

## Building RPM Packages

For Red Hat-based distributions, you can build RPM packages:

```sh
./packaging/build_packages.sh --os rhel8 --pg 17
```

Supported RPM distributions:
- rhel8 (Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 compatible)
- rhel9 (Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 compatible)

Supported PG versions: 15, 16, 17, 18

### RPM Build Prerequisites

[Optional] Before building RPM packages, you can validate your environment:

```sh
./packaging/rpm/validate_rpm_build.sh
```

This script checks:
- Docker installation and availability
- Network connectivity for package repositories
- Access to required base images

### Example RPM Build Commands

```sh
# Build for RHEL 9 with PostgreSQL 16
./packaging/build_packages.sh --os rhel9 --pg 16

# Build with testing enabled
./packaging/build_packages.sh --os rhel8 --pg 17 --test-clean-install
```

## Output

Packages can be found at the `packages` directory by default, but it can be configured with the `--output-dir` option.

**Note:** The packages do not include pg_documentdb_distributed in the `internal` directory.


## Building Gateway Packages

To build gateway packages, use the `build_gateway_packages.sh` script. This script supports the same OS and PostgreSQL version options as the main package builder.

For example, to build a gateway package for Debian 12 and PostgreSQL 18, run:

```sh
./packaging/gateway/build_gateway_packages.sh --os deb12 --pg 18 --version 0.114.0
```

To build a gateway RPM package for RHEL 9, run:

```sh
./packaging/gateway/build_gateway_packages.sh --os rhel9 --pg 18 --version 0.114.0
```

The `--version` argument is required: it pins the package version and the gateway
binary's reported version, so the build fails fast if it is omitted.

Supported DEB/Ubuntu distributions:
- deb11 — Debian 11 (bullseye)
- deb12 — Debian 12 (bookworm)
- deb13 — Debian 13 (trixie)
- ubuntu22.04 — Ubuntu 22.04 (jammy)
- ubuntu24.04 — Ubuntu 24.04 (noble)

Supported RPM distributions:
- rhel8 (Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 compatible)
- rhel9 (Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 compatible)

Supported PG versions: 15, 16, 17, 18

> **Gateway PostgreSQL 16+ requirement.** The gateway binary is
> PostgreSQL-version-agnostic and builds for any version above, but the
> package-managed local gateway registration — `documentdb-register-gateway` and
> the `documentdb-setup` stand-alone wizard — requires **PostgreSQL 16 or newer**.
> The gateway authenticates each client's data-pool connection *as that client's
> role* over the local socket with an empty password, relying on `pg_ident.conf`
> group membership (`+role`) to map the gateway OS user to the member role — a
> feature PostgreSQL introduced in 16, with no password-based fallback for
> SCRAM-authenticated users. `documentdb-register-gateway` and `documentdb-setup`
> therefore reject PostgreSQL 15 (its `--restore` path still works). PostgreSQL 15
> remains fully supported for **extension-only** use (`CREATE EXTENSION
> documentdb`). The legacy `documentdb-local` container image uses a separate
> container-local trust model and is unaffected.

The resulting gateway packages will be placed in the output directory (default: `packaging`). You can change the output location with the `--output-dir` option.

### Gateway package test coverage

Pass `--test-clean-install` to build the package, clean-install it in a fresh
container, and run an install smoke:

```sh
./packaging/gateway/build_gateway_packages.sh --os rhel8 --pg 17 --version 0.114.0 --test-clean-install
```

> **Host build tooling:** `--test-clean-install` assembles the stand-alone
> "extras" (`documentdb-postgresql-tools`, `documentdb-common`, `documentdb-N`,
> and the `documentdb` meta package) **on the host** — DEB via `dpkg-deb`, RPM
> via `rpmbuild` (plus `systemd-rpm-macros` on RHEL/Fedora) — while only the
> extension and gateway packages are built inside Docker. Install the matching
> host tool first (`sudo apt install dpkg` or `sudo apt install rpm` on
> Debian/Ubuntu, `brew install dpkg` on macOS) or the build fails when it
> reaches the extras step.
> `build_extra_packages.sh --type {deb|rpm} --check-build-deps-only` preflights
> this for you and fails early with an actionable message. The per-package DEB
> builders avoid GNU-only constructs (`sed -i`, `date -d`) so they also work
> under BSD/macOS Bash and minimal container shells. The overall local smoke,
> however, targets a Linux host — the build relies on a Bash 4+ /
> GNU-coreutils userland and the RPM extras need `rpmbuild` — so on macOS run it
> inside a Linux container or WSL rather than natively.

| Family | Targets | What the clean-install test does |
|--------|---------|----------------------------------|
| DEB | deb11 / deb12 / deb13 / ubuntu22.04 / ubuntu24.04 | Installs the extension + gateway packages on a real PostgreSQL, starts the service, and exercises the wire protocol end to end (`packaging/gateway/test/Dockerfile_deb_gateway_test`). |
| RPM | rhel8 / rhel9 | Clean-installs all four Track 1 RPMs and runs the full RPM E2E suite (`packaging/test_packages/Dockerfile-rhel-gateway-test` → `test-gateway-install-entrypoint-rpm.sh`): package-boundary/manifest checks, `%preun`/`%posttrans` scriptlets against a fake `systemctl`, static unit verification, `documentdb-setup` greenfield provisioning, ident-map/peer-auth checks, wire-protocol CRUD, `--load-sample-data`, and `rpm -e` cleanup. This also exercises the wrapper's privilege-drop path as root, which is sensitive to the EL8 `runuser` differences. |

Both the DEB and RPM gateway build/test paths are wired into `build_gateway_packages.sh`.

Gateway runtime packages install the gateway binary, packaged configuration, and its systemd unit. (The `documentdb-setup` wizard, the helper scripts, and the sample data used by stand-alone package installs are shipped by `documentdb-common`, pulled in by `documentdb-N`.) They do not choose a PostgreSQL major for you. Install `documentdb-gateway` together with the DocumentDB extension package for the PostgreSQL major you want (for example, `apt install documentdb-gateway postgresql-18-documentdb` on Debian/Ubuntu or `dnf install documentdb-gateway postgresql18-documentdb` on RHEL-family systems). If more than one PostgreSQL major is installed, pass `--pg-version` to `documentdb-setup` to pin the version you want. Packaged sample data is optional: use `documentdb-setup --load-sample-data` to enable it, or `--skip-init-data` to disable it explicitly in scripts. `--load-sample-data` requires `mongosh` to be installed. When `documentdb-setup` provisions a self-managed PostgreSQL instance, it uses the per-major private Unix socket directory `/run/documentdb-local/N/postgresql` and persists the startup state so packaged installs restart cleanly after a reboot.

## Building the PostgreSQL Administrator Tools Package

The `documentdb-postgresql-tools` package ships `documentdb-tune`,
`documentdb-createcluster`, `documentdb-register-gateway`, and
`documentdb-gateway-admin`. These are administrator helpers that mutate
PostgreSQL state (postgresql.conf, pg_hba.conf, pg_ident.conf, gateway
role) and are required by both Workflow B (BYO local PG + gateway) and
Workflow C (stand-alone). The package only Suggests the gateway and
extension runtime packages — it can be installed first for preview /
dry-run use.

To build the DEB:

```sh
./packaging/postgresql-tools/build-postgresql-tools-deb.sh --version 0.114.0 --output-dir packaging
```

`documentdb-register-gateway` checks at runtime that the
`documentdb-gateway` OS user exists (created by installing the
`documentdb-gateway` runtime package) and exits with a clear prerequisite
error otherwise. This keeps the boundary explicit: tools mutate
PostgreSQL on behalf of an already-installed gateway.
