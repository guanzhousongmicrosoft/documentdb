# Smoke tests for scripts/run_pytest_split.sh's collection guards (OSS lane).
#
# These exist because the guards are the part of the script
# that must FAIL CLOSED, and two of them were once silently disabled by
# pure-bash mistakes that no amount of reading caught:
#   * `grep -c ... || echo 0` emitted "0\n0", so the callers' `-eq 0` tests died
#     with "integer expression expected" and the zero-collection guard never ran.
#   * `X=$(collect_count ...)` ran the function in a command-substitution
#     SUBSHELL, so the collect exit code it stored in a global never reached the
#     parent and the collect-error guard always compared the initial 0.
# Both are invisible unless the script is actually executed, hence this file.
#
# `python3 -m pytest` is stubbed so the guards can be driven without an engine;
# everything else (functional_gate.py, python3 -c) runs for real.
#
# Usage (from the repository root, the tree that holds documentdb-local/):
#   bash documentdb-local/functional-tests/tests/test_run_pytest_split.sh
