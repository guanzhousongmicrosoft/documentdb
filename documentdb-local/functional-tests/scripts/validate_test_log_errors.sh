# Scan engine/gateway logs for internal-error signatures.
#
# Exits 1 when any signature is present so a caller can gate on it. The
# functional workflow does not: it converts the non-zero exit into a warning
# annotation, because a step exiting non-zero under continue-on-error still
# renders as an ERROR annotation on an otherwise green run.
#
# Output is a per-signature count plus the distinct messages behind it. A raw
# dump is unreadable: one gateway error line runs past 500 characters, and a
# single known gap accounts for hundreds of them, so the distinct-message
# summary is what makes a NEW signature visible.
#
# Usage: validate_test_log_errors.sh <log-file> [<log-file>...]
